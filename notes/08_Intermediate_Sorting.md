# Intermediate Sorting Algorithms

- much more difficult! don't be scared
- Make sure to understand the limitations we have learned so far
- These are much faster!
- the ones we have learned so far don't scale well,
- if you try bubble sort on 100,000 it takes quite a while!
  - not ideal!
- generally these improve the time complexity to O(n log n) from O(n^2)

### Merge Sort

- [Merge Sort](../algs/JsAlgs%26DSClass/Sorting/merge.ts)
- combination of two things, merging and sorting!
- exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 elements are always sorted
- divide the larger array into smaller arrays then build up the new sorted array
