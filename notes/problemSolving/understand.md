# Understand the Problem

- Restate the problem in your own words?
- What are the inputs?
- What are the outputs?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
  - may not be able to answer right away
- How can I label the important pieces

- Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the sum.
  1. A summation function
  2. Are they Floats, very large numbers? Negative? Whole Integers? Is it always two inputs? Or what if someone inputs one?
  3. Simpler, but still need to decide if the return is a string, number, float?
  4. Need information about passing one number in?
  5. we have add, num1, num2, return sum.
