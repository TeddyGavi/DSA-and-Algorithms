- this is the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer
- comes up all the time in INTERVIEWS
-

## How Do you improve?

- Devise a plan
- master common problem solving patterns

## Poblem Solving Approach

- [understand the problem](./problemSolving/understand.md)
- [explore concrete examples](./problemSolving/concrete-ex.md)
- [break it down](./problemSolving/breakItDown.md)
- [solve simplify](./problemSolving/solve-Simplify.md)
- [look back and refactor](./problemSolving/lookBack-Refactor.md)
