- this is the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer
- comes up all the time in INTERVIEWS
-

## How Do you improve?

- Devise a plan
- master common problem solving patterns

## Poblem Solving Approach

- [understand the problem](./problemSolving/1_understand.md)
- [explore concrete examples](./problemSolving/2_concrete-ex.md)
- [break it down](./problemSolving/3_breakItDown.md)
- [solve simplify](./problemSolving/4_solve-Simplify.md)
- [look back and refactor](./problemSolving/5_lookBack-Refactor.md)
