# Frequency Counter

- this pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- this can often avoid the need for nested loops with arrays strings
- O(n^2) is nested!

#### Same

- Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays, the function should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array. the frequency of values must be the same.

#### Valid Anagram

- Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters such as cinema, formed from iceman.
