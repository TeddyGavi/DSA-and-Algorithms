# Doubly Linked List

## What is it?

- All that we do is add another pointer,
- Each node has a pointer to the next node and the previous node
- This makes a huge difference in some of the methods
- Take more memory!

- Need to make sure that you keep track of the next and prev of each node
- push! Add at end
