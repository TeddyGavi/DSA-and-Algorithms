# Heaps

- Heaps are a tree!
- Many different types of heaps
- Focus on Binary heaps, specifically min and max heaps
- always take up the least amount of space possible
- **left** child is filled first
- no implied ordering between siblings
- used to implement priority queue!

## Max Binary Heap

- parent nodes are always larger than the children
- root is largest!

## Min Binary Heap

- Parent nodes are always smaller than children
- root is the smallest!
