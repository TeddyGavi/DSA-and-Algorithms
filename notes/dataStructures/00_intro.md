# DATA STRUCTURES!

- many many different DS
- What is a data structure?
- collections of values, the relationships among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data
- different structures excel at different things some are common and others are specialized
- the more time you spend as a developer the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures
- we have already worked with them unknowingly!
- INTERVIEWS!
- there is no one best
- ie: With map/location data
  - use a graph!
- ie: need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and the end? With a million data points
  - use a linked list!
- web scraping nested HTML?
  - use a tree
- Scheduler?
  - use a binary heap!
