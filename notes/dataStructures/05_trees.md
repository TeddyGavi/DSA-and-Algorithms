# Trees

- What is a Tree?
  A data structure that consists of nodes in **parent / child** relationship

- Each node may point more than one node, or none! Only one root
- Trees are non-linear, multiple pathways through the structure
- a node can only point to a child, nodes can't point to siblings!

**Root** top node of tree
**child** a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
**parent** the opposite of a child!
**siblings** a group of nodes with the same parents
**leaf** a node with no children
**edge** the connection between on node and another

## Uses of Trees

- HTML DOM
- Network routing
- Abstract syntax trees
  A way of describing the syntax of a programming language
- AI
  A miny-max tree
  A decision tree
- Folders in an operating system
- JSON

## Binary Trees

- Each node can have at most two children
- A **search tree**
  - sorted in a particular order

## BST

- Given any node on the tree any node that is less than is located on the **left** branch
- any node that is greater is located on the **right** branch
